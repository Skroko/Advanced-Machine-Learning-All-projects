# Advanced-Machine-Learning-All-projects

## Course description

The Advanced Machine Learning course focuses on three main areas: Generative Models, Geodesics and Latent Spaces, and Graph Machine Learning. Students learn to implement and evaluate Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with different priors, and assess model performance through metrics like test set log-likelihood. They explore geometric properties of latent spaces, implementing algorithms for Fisher-Rao geodesics and analyzing their behavior. The course also covers graph machine learning, where students create generative models for graphs using techniques like message passing neural networks, and evaluate these models using metrics such as novelty, uniqueness, and graph statistics. These objectives aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced machine learning techniques, both theoretical and practical.

# Overview

3 main parts:
- Generative models
- Latent space analysis
- Graph neural networks

# Projects

## Generative Models

In this project, we aim to train and assess a variety of deep generative models on a binarized and a standard MNIST
dataset. We split the data into a training set (n=60,000) and a test set (n=10,000). Our project has two parts. In the first
part, we look at the impact of different priors on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). In the second part, we train a flow
based model, and a DDPM. We compare the quality of the samples these models produce to each other and a VAE model.

the density is proportional to the brightness of the region
